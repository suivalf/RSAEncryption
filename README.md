# RSAEncryption
ðŸ”’ Message encryption using the RSA algorithm. Implemented in Java. Using JavaFX for GUI.

RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman) cryptosystem uses a public key for encrypting a message 
and a private key for decrypting it.

1. Generate 2 (large) distinct prime numbers: p and q.
2. Computes n = p*q
3. Computes Ï•(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
4. Select e between 1 and Ï•(n), having the property gcd(e, Ï•(n)) = 1.
5. Computes d*e = mod(Ï•(n)).
The public key is hte pair (n, e), while the private key is the pair (n, d)
